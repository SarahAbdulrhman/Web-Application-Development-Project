             Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 represents an ambitious plan for the country's future. Under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the vision aims to transform the Saudi economy and society. It focuses on reducing the kingdom's dependence on oil by diversifying its economy and attracting foreign investment. The Red Sea Project and NEOM, known as "The Line," are two flagship projects that align with Vision 2030's goals.
             The Red Sea Project is a luxury tourism development on the Saudi west coast, stretching across more than 90 islands. It aims to become a global destination for travelers, offering stunning natural beauty, sustainable practices, and unique experiences. The project aims to create jobs, promote tourism, and contribute to the country's economic diversification.
             NEOM, often referred to as "The Line," is a futuristic, $500 billion megacity project that aims to be a global hub for innovation, technology, and sustainability. Stretching across 26,500 square kilometers, it will be powered by renewable energy and will focus on sectors such as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, and entertainment. NEOM is designed to be a model of urban development and environmental sustainability.
